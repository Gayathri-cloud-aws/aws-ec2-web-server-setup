1. AWS EC2 Instance (Windows Server) 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Server will be deployed as the core component, hosting the web server. 
Amazon EC2 provides a virtual machine with an operating system, allowing users 
to run Windows Server instances for web hosting purposes. 
Instance Type: The instance type (such as t2. micro for basic usage or larger types 
for production workloads) should be selected based on the web server’s traffic load 
and performance requirements. 
IIS (Internet Information Services): IIS will be installed on the Windows Server to 
serve web content and applications. It’s the default web server for Windows 
environments and supports both static and dynamic websites. 
 
2. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The VPC provides an isolated network environment within AWS where you can 
deploy your resources, such as EC2 instances. This ensures that the instance 
operates within a secure, controlled network. 
Subnets: 
Public Subnet: The EC2 instance running the Windows Server will be placed in a 
public subnet so that it can be accessed via the internet. 
Internet Gateway: Attached to the VPC, the internet gateway allows inbound and 
outbound internet traffic to the public facing EC2 instance. 
 
3. Security Groups
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------==
Security Groups act as a firewall, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to your 
EC2 instance. For a Windows Server, you’ll need to configure: 
RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol): Allow inbound traffic on port 3389 to connect to 
the Windows Server for administration purposes. 
HTTP/HTTPS Traffic: Allow inbound traffic on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 
(HTTPS) to handle web server requests. 
The security group will be configured to allow only specific IP addresses to access 
the instance for RDP, ensuring security. 
 
4. Elastic IP 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An Elastic IP may be associated with the EC2 instance to provide a static public IP 
address. This ensures that the web server’s IP remains constant even if the instance 
is restarted, making it easier for users to connect to the website or service.

5. DNS and Route 53
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amazon Route 53 can be used to manage domain name resolution for your 
web server. This allows users to access the web server using a custom domain 
(e.g., www.yourwebsite.com) instead of an IP address. 
• DNS Configuration: Route 53 will be configured to route traffic to the 
Elastic IP address of your Windows Server instance. 

6. Amazon CloudWatch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• Amazon CloudWatch can be integrated to monitor the performance of the 
EC2 instance, track resource usage, and set up alarms for performance 
issues, such as CPU, memory, or disk space utilization. 
• CloudWatch allows for proactive management of the web server by 
providing real- time insights into the server’s health and activity. 

7. Auto-Scaling 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Auto-scaling groups can be set up to automatically increase or decrease the number 
of Windows Server instances based on traffic demand. This ensures that the server 
 
can handle spikes in traffic while minimizing costs by scaling down when demand 
is low. 
 
8. Data Storage 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store) can be used as a persistent storage solution for 
the EC2 instance, storing the web server’s data or application files. 
 
STEPS TO IMPLEMENT:
==========================================================================
Step 1: Create an AWS Account 
• If you don’t have an AWS account, go to the AWS website, and sign up 
for a free account. 
• After registration, sign in to the AWS Management 
Console.  

Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance (Windows Server) 
Navigate to EC2: 
In the AWS Management Console, go to Services and select EC2 under the Compute section. 
 
Click on Launch Instance: 
On the EC2 dashboard, click on Launch Instance to start creating a virtual 
machine. 

Choose an Amazon Machine Image (AMI): 
• Select a Windows Server AMI. You can choose between different Windows 
Server versions, such as Windows Server 2019 or Windows Server 2022. 
These AMIs include IIS (Internet Information Services) which will be used 
as the web server. 
• If eligible for the free tier, select Microsoft Windows Server Free Tier 
Eligible. 

Choose Instance Type: 
Choose an instance type. For basic usage, select t2. micro (which is free tier 
eligible). You can select larger instance types based on your expected workload. 
 
Configure Instance Details: 
• Network: Select your VPC (or the default VPC). 
• Subnet: Choose a public subnet to ensure the instance has internet access. 
• Auto-assign Public IP: Ensure this is set to Enable so the instance can be 
accessed from the internet. 
 
Add Storage: 
The default storage size is 30 GB, but you can modify it based on your 
requirements. For web hosting, ensure there is enough space for your website files. 

Add Tags: 
You can add tags to help identify and manage your EC2 instance, such as Name: 
Windows Webserver. 

Configure Security Group: 
Create a new security group or use an existing one. The security group controls 
traffic to your instance. 
• RDP: Add a rule to allow inbound traffic on port 3389 for RDP access. 
HTTP: Add a rule for port 80 to allow inbound HTTP traffic for web. 
access. HTTPS: Add a rule for port 443 to allow secure web. 
• Restrict the RDP rule to your IP address for security. 
 
Review and Launch: 
Review all the configurations and click Launch. 
 
Choose an existing key pair or create a new one to securely connect via RDP. 
Download the private key file (.pem file) and keep it safe. 
 
Step 3: Connect to the EC2 Instance 
Obtain the Public IP: 
Once the instance is running, navigate to the EC2 dashboard and locate your 
instance. Copy the public IP address or public DNS. 
 
Download RDP File: 
1.Click on Connect in the EC2 console and select RDP Client. 
2.Download the RDP file provided by AWS for easy 
connection.  
 
Retrieve Administrator Password: 
To connect, you will need the Windows administrator password. Select your 
instance, click Actions > Get Windows Password. Upload the .pem file and decrypt 
the password.
 
Connect Using RDP: 
Open the RDP file you downloaded and enter the administrator password to access 
your Windows Server. 

Step 4: Install and Configure IIS (Internet Information Services) 
Access Server Manager: 
Once connected to the Windows Server, the Server Manager will open 
automatically. 
Add Roles and Features: 
In the Server Manager dashboard, click on Add Roles and Features. 
Follow the wizard, selecting Web Server (IIS) as the role to install. This will 
enable IIS on your Windows Server. 
 
Configure IIS: 
After the installation, IIS will be running by default. You can verify it by opening 
your browser and typing http://localhost or the public IP address of the EC2 
instance. 
You should see the IIS default page, confirming that the web server is running. 
Step 5: Upload and host a website. 
Access IIS Directory: 
The default directory for hosting web files is located at C:\inetpub\wwwroot\. 
Upload Your Website Files: 
Transfer your website files to this directory using RDP or a file transfer tool. 
If you don't have a website ready, you can create a simple index.html page and 
place it in the wwwroot folder. 
 
Access the Website:  
Open a browser and enter your EC2 instance’s public IP address in the URL bar. If 
the setup is correct, your website should load.
